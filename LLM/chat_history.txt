By using the function library you are provided. move arm up and down tiny bit and print something funny make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.```python
from Lib.xarm7.FunctionLib import FunctionLib
import rclpy
import time

# Initialize the ROS node
rclpy.init()
node = rclpy.create_node('gpt')

# Initialize the function library
lib = FunctionLib()

# Get the current end effector pose
current_pose = lib.get_current_end_effector_pose()

# Extract the current Z position
current_z = current_pose[2]

# Move the arm up by 0.01 meters
lib.move_arm(current_pose[0], current_pose[1], current_z + 0.01, current_pose[3], current_pose[4], current_pose[5])

# Wait for a short period to ensure the movement completes
time.sleep(1.0)

# Move the arm down by 0.01 meters (back to the original position)
lib.move_arm(current_pose[0], current_pose[1], current_z - 0.01, current_pose[3], current_pose[4], current_pose[5])

# Wait for a short period to ensure the movement completes
time.sleep(1.0)

# Move the arm up again by 0.01 meters
lib.move_arm(current_pose[0], current_pose[1], current_z + 0.01, current_pose[3], current_pose[4], current_pose[5])

# Wait for a short period to ensure the movement completes
time.sleep(1.0)

# Move the arm back to the original Z position
lib.move_arm(current_pose[0], current_pose[1], current_z, current_pose[3], current_pose[4], current_pose[5])

# Print something funny
print("I'm a little teapot, short and stout!")

# Move the arm back to the home position (assuming home position is x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0, roll=0.0, pitch=0.0, yaw=0.0)
lib.move_arm(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

Explanation:

1. The ROS node for the xarm7 and the function library are initialized.
2. The current pose of the end effector is retrieved.
3. The arm is moved up by 0.01 meters.
4. A short wait is added to ensure each movement is completed before the next one begins.
5. The arm is moved back down by 0.01 meters (returning to the original Z position).
6. The arm is moved up again by 0.01 meters.
7. The arm is then moved back to its original Z position.
8. A funny message is printed to the console.
9. Finally, the arm is moved back to the home position (assumed to be at the origin with no rotation).
